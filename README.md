This is the final project on the Odin Project Course! 
It consists of all the things I learned from the course as well as a new way
to learn new methods/ways to code in the three languages.
To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in your browser using the terminal on Mac or 
for Windows (powershell? i dont know if its the same as terminal though) and from there the calculator
should open up! 

anyways Enjoy and let me know what adjustments i can make or that you suggest, I will gladly take feedback!
